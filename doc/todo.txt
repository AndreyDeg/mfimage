Unterst√ºtze Format:
---------------------
TIF:	
- Reads all baseline tiffs, except for "mask only" and ignores "grey response curve" (obsoleted by Tiff version 6)
- Beyond baseline tiff, it also reads:
  - "SEPARATED" photometric as CMYK if "INKSET_CMYK" is present in TIFFTAG_INKSET, and assumes CMYK if TIFFTAG_INKSET is omitted and there are at least 4 samples per pixel
  - alpha-mask (EXTRASAMPLE_ASSOCALPHA) from extraSamples.
  - can apply halftonehints (TIFFTAG_HALFTONEHINTS)
  - tiled tiffs (only completely, not partial tiles) - tiled+planar untested, probably doesn't work (rare combination)
  
  
that is:
	RGB (contig & planar):
		8 bits per sample with/without ALPHA mask
		16 bits per sample with/without ALPHA mask
	RGB-Palette or indexed
		16 color (4 bits per sample) RGB palette 8/16 bits per sample - no ALPHA mask!  -- UNTESTED
		256 color (8 bits per sample) RGB palette 8/16 bits per sample - no ALPHA mask!
	GRAY / Black&White:
		16 bits per sample w/wo alpha (alpha untested)
		8 bits per sample w/wo alpha (alpha untested)
		4 bits per sample w/wo alpha (alpha untested) -- UNTESTED
		1 bits per sample ("bilevel")- w/wo alpha (alpha untested)
	CMYK (contig & planar):
		8 bits per sample with/without ALPHA mask
		16 bits per sample with/without ALPHA mask
	writes:
		RGB 8/16 w+w/o Alpha mask
		CMYK 8/16 w+w/o Alpha mask
		GRAY 8/16 w+w/o Alpha mask
		- ONLY WRITES Contigous, not planar!

does NOT support:
- other than 8 or 16 bits per sample at this time (except for Gray 1+4 bits per sample).
----------------------------
TIFF todo: 
- Read number of pages in multipage tiff without reading all files ?
- float rgb, gray + CMYK (+float in image)
- CIELab TIFF (read+write+internal in image)

=====================
PNG: reads all pngs formats and flags
=====================
- BMP write with RLE
- BMP test monochrome
=======================
PCX: reads 8 bit VGA palette, 8 bit gray, 24bit RGB (untested), RLE or uncompressed. 1,2,4 bit not supported, Alpha Masks not supported. V5 only.
=======================
TGA: ???
=======================
GIF: All gifs
=======================
JPEG: All known other than unspecified Alpha extension.
=======================h
JPEG2000: currently only srgb, gray, cmyk is read right. Only JP2 works. No Alpha.
THere's a lot of stuff left to do (color space convertion?, Alpha channel, dpi, tiles?).
OPenJPEG is slow and not good. Seems to auto-convert everything to sRGB.
